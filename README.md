# Intruder_Surveillance_System

Description: 

Developed a smart surveillance system tailored for farm security to detect and alert farmers of potential intruders.

Real-time monitoring: Implemented a system with real-time video surveillance, enabling farmers to monitor their farmland remotely via mobile or web applications.

Intruder detection: Integrated motion detection technology to identify unauthorized intruders, such as humans or animals, triggering instant alerts.

Automated alerts: Designed the system to send immediate notifications to the farmerâ€™s phone or email, allowing for quick action in case of a security breach.

Customizable alert settings: Enabled farmers to customize alert thresholds for different types of intrusions, distinguishing between wildlife and human threats to minimize false alarms.

Low-power and weather-resistant hardware: Utilized energy-efficient cameras and sensors, optimized for outdoor conditions, ensuring continuous monitoring even in remote areas with limited power resources.

Data logging: Provided a feature to log detected incidents, allowing farmers to review past activity and assess any recurring security issues.

Technology stack: Used [mention tech stack, e.g., Python, OpenCV, Raspberry Pi] to build and deploy the system, ensuring low maintenance and cost-effectiveness.
